            </p>

            <h3>Experience:</h3>
            <p>
              Dr. K.K. Aggarwal had an extensive and diverse professional
              journey: Senior Consultant, Physician, and Cardiologist:
              Moolchand Medcity, New Delhi (until 2017). He was a pioneer in
              using clot busters for acute myocardial infarction (1984) and
              introduced color Doppler echocardiography in North India (1987).
              National President, Indian Medical Association (IMA):
              (2016-2017) President, Heart Care Foundation of India (HCFI): He
              founded and led this organization dedicated to public health.
              President, Confederation of Medical Associations in Asia and
              Oceania (CMAAO): (2019-2020) Honorary Secretary-General, Medical
              Council of India (MCI).
            </p>

            <h3>Philosophy:</h3>
            <p>
              Dr. K.K. Aggarwal's philosophy on health and medicine was deeply
              rooted in a holistic and public-centric approach, often blending
              modern medical science with traditional Indian wisdom. Key
              aspects of his philosophy include: "One Health" Concept: He
              strongly believed in the interconnectedness of human health with
              animal health, plant health, and the environment. This reflects
              the ancient Vedic saying, "VasudhaivaKutumbakam" (the whole
              world is my family), and
              "Yathapindetathabrahmande,yathabrahmandetathapinde" (as is the
              microcosm, so is the macrocosm). He emphasized that the human
              body is a replica of the universe and that wellness should
              prioritize this interconnectedness.

    <h2>Health & Lifestyle Tips</h2>

    <h3>Healthy Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>Adopting a healthy lifestyle doesn't require drastic changes—it starts with small, consistent habits. Begin your
      day with stretching, deep breathing, or a short walk. Eat balanced meals with whole grains, seasonal vegetables,
      fruits, and lean protein. Avoid processed sugars, fried foods, and excessive salt. Drink plenty of water
      throughout the day and limit sugary drinks. Get at least 7–8 hours of quality sleep by maintaining a regular
      bedtime and minimizing screen time before bed. Physical activity is essential—aim for at least 30 minutes a day,
      five days a week. Quit smoking, reduce alcohol, and take regular breaks to reduce stress. Your mind and body both
      need attention, so make wellness a lifestyle, not just a goal.</p>

    <h3>Medication Tips</h3>
    <p>Using medication properly is crucial to effective treatment and safety. Always follow your doctor’s instructions
      and never stop taking prescribed medicines suddenly. Keep a written list of your medications and their timings.
      Read labels carefully—look for expiration dates, dosages, and side effect warnings. Avoid mixing medication with
      alcohol unless specifically allowed. If you forget a dose, don’t double the next one—consult your doctor. Store
      medicines away from direct sunlight and moisture. For chronic patients, tools like pill organizers and reminders
      can prevent missed doses. If you experience side effects, don’t stop the medicine without medical advice. Be
      informed and stay compliant—it makes your treatment more effective.</p>

    <h3>Seasonal Health</h3>
    <p>Each season brings its own set of health challenges. In summer, protect yourself from dehydration by drinking
      8–10 glasses of water daily and avoiding outdoor activity during peak heat hours. In the monsoon, guard against
      infections by consuming freshly cooked food, using mosquito repellents, and avoiding street food. During winter,
      protect yourself from cold-related issues—layer your clothing, take vitamin C-rich fruits, and avoid sudden
      temperature exposure. For all seasons, prioritize hygiene: wash your hands frequently, wear weather-appropriate
      clothing, and boost immunity through nutrition and hydration. Adjusting your routine based on seasonal needs helps
      you stay resilient year-round.</p>

    <h3>Mental Wellness</h3>
    <p>Mental health is vital for your overall well-being. Begin by acknowledging your emotions and creating space for
      self-care. Take breaks during the day, talk to loved ones, and don't hesitate to reach out to a therapist if
      needed. Practice deep breathing, journaling, or mindful meditation to reduce stress and anxiety. Sleep, diet, and
      physical activity also impact mental health—stay active, eat clean, and sleep well. Set boundaries with work and
      screen time, and avoid information overload from social media or news. By making mental wellness a daily priority,
      you improve your focus, mood, and quality of life.</p>

    <h3>Women’s Health</h3>
    <p>Women's health requires special attention, especially in areas of hormonal balance, reproductive care, and
      nutrition. Prioritize regular health checkups, including thyroid tests, breast exams, and pelvic screenings.
      Maintain menstrual hygiene and track your cycles to detect irregularities early. During menstruation and
      menopause, stay hydrated, eat iron-rich foods, and get enough calcium to support bone health. If you're pregnant
      or postpartum, follow your gynecologist’s nutritional and mental health guidelines. Exercise regularly to keep
      hormones balanced, and manage stress with yoga or relaxation techniques. Don’t ignore fatigue or unexplained
      symptoms—they could be early signs of treatable conditions.</p>
